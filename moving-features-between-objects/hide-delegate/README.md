**Hide Delegate**

`Hide delegate` by creating a `delegate method` in `server` object.

We apply this technique when there are several delegates to call each after.  
By providing a delegate method on the server object to `client codes`
* We may protect clients from further changes when there is a change on delegates or on server (Changes do not propagate from server down to client).
* Strengthen the `Encapsulation`.

**Example**

_Issue_

```csharp
// TODO:
```

_Refactoring_

```csharp
// TODO:
```
Encapsulation means that `objects need to know less about other parts of the system` causes to be `told about the change to fewer objects`.
`Method chanining` and the `train wreck` are the other definitions of these `delegates` that we may encounter.
