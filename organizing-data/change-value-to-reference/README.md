**Change Value to Reference**

We have many same instances of a class(they are some sort of copies) and we want exactly one instance to use everywhere.  
So with this technique we change object into a `reference object`.  
Reference objects are usually like `customer, user, product` since copy of a same user would be abnormal in system.

Example

__Issue__
```csharp
// TODO
```

__Refactoring__

```csharp
// TODO
```
